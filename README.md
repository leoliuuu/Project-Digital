# Project-Digital
This the final project of the Software Design class in fall 2017 at the Olin College of Engineering. 

## Description
Our team have created an artificial intelligence to play an arcade game against a human opponent. We have recreated the simple arcade game Connect 4, and the game itself calculates the optimal way of playing it for our bot.
